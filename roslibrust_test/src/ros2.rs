# MenuEntry message.
#
# Each InteractiveMarker message has an array of MenuEntry messages.
# A collection of MenuEntries together describe a
# menu/submenu/subsubmenu/etc tree, though they are stored in a flat
# array.  The tree structure is represented by giving each menu entry
# an ID number and a "parent_id" field.  Top-level entries are the
# ones with parent_id = 0.  Menu entries are ordered within their
# level the same way they are ordered in the containing array.  Parent
# entries must appear before their children.
#
# Example:
# - id = 3
#   parent_id = 0
#   title = "fun"
# - id = 2
#   parent_id = 0
#   title = "robot"
# - id = 4
#   parent_id = 2
#   title = "pr2"
# - id = 5
#   parent_id = 2
#   title = "turtle"
#
# Gives a menu tree like this:
#  - fun
#  - robot
#    - pr2
#    - turtle

# ID is a number for each menu entry.  Must be unique within the
# control, and should never be 0.

# array.  The tree structure is represented by giving each menu entry
# an ID number and a "parent_id" field.  Top-level entries are the
# ones with parent_id = 0.  Menu entries are ordered within their
# level the same way they are ordered in the containing array.  Parent
# entries must appear before their children.
#
# Example:
# - id = 3
#   parent_id = 0
#   title = "fun"
# - id = 2
#   parent_id = 0
#   title = "robot"
# - id = 4
#   parent_id = 2
#   title = "pr2"
# - id = 5
#   parent_id = 2
#   title = "turtle"
#
# Gives a menu tree like this:
#  - fun
#  - robot
#    - pr2
#    - turtle

# ID is a number for each menu entry.  Must be unique within the
# control, and should never be 0.

MSG: visualization_msgs/MenuEntry
# MenuEntry message.
#
# Each InteractiveMarker message has an array of MenuEntry messages.
# A collection of MenuEntries together describe a
# menu/submenu/subsubmenu/etc tree, though they are stored in a flat
# array.  The tree structure is represented by giving each menu entry
# an ID number and a "parent_id" field.  Top-level entries are the
# ones with parent_id = 0.  Menu entries are ordered within their
# level the same way they are ordered in the containing array.  Parent
# entries must appear before their children.
#
# Example:
# - id = 3
#   parent_id = 0
#   title = "fun"
# - id = 2
#   parent_id = 0
#   title = "robot"
# - id = 4
#   parent_id = 2
#   title = "pr2"
# - id = 5
#   parent_id = 2
#   title = "turtle"
#
# Gives a menu tree like this:
#  - fun
#  - robot
#    - pr2
#    - turtle

# ID is a number for each menu entry.  Must be unique within the
# control, and should never be 0.
uint32 id

# ID of the parent of this menu entry, if it is a submenu.  If this
# menu entry is a top-level entry, set parent_id to 0.

# Arguments to command indicated by command_type (below)

MSG: visualization_msgs/MenuEntry
# MenuEntry message.
#
# Each InteractiveMarker message has an array of MenuEntry messages.
# A collection of MenuEntries together describe a
# menu/submenu/subsubmenu/etc tree, though they are stored in a flat
# array.  The tree structure is represented by giving each menu entry
# an ID number and a "parent_id" field.  Top-level entries are the
# ones with parent_id = 0.  Menu entries are ordered within their
# level the same way they are ordered in the containing array.  Parent
# entries must appear before their children.
#
# Example:
# - id = 3
#   parent_id = 0
#   title = "fun"
# - id = 2
#   parent_id = 0
#   title = "robot"
# - id = 4
#   parent_id = 2
#   title = "pr2"
# - id = 5
#   parent_id = 2
#   title = "turtle"
#
# Gives a menu tree like this:
#  - fun
#  - robot
#    - pr2
#    - turtle

# ID is a number for each menu entry.  Must be unique within the
# control, and should never be 0.

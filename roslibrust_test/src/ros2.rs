# If we have parallel copies of 2D datatypes every UI and other pipeline will end up needing to have dual interfaces to plot everything. And you will end up with not being able to use 3D tools for 2D use cases even if they're completely valid, as you'd have to reimplement it with different inputs and outputs. It's not particularly hard to plot the 2D pose or compute the yaw error for the Pose message and there are already tools and libraries that can do this for you.# This expresses a position and orientation on a 2D manifold.

#   image_rect       - monochrome, rectified

# The image_pipeline contains packages (image_proc, stereo_image_proc)

MSG: visualization_msgs/MenuEntry
# MenuEntry message.
#
# Each InteractiveMarker message has an array of MenuEntry messages.
# A collection of MenuEntries together describe a
# menu/submenu/subsubmenu/etc tree, though they are stored in a flat
# array.  The tree structure is represented by giving each menu entry
# an ID number and a "parent_id" field.  Top-level entries are the
# ones with parent_id = 0.  Menu entries are ordered within their
# level the same way they are ordered in the containing array.  Parent
# entries must appear before their children.
#
# Example:
# - id = 3
#   parent_id = 0
#   title = "fun"
# - id = 2
#   parent_id = 0
#   title = "robot"
# - id = 4
#   parent_id = 2
#   title = "pr2"
# - id = 5
#   parent_id = 2
#   title = "turtle"
#
# Gives a menu tree like this:
#  - fun
#  - robot
#    - pr2
#    - turtle

# ID is a number for each menu entry.  Must be unique within the
# control, and should never be 0.
uint32 id

# ID of the parent of this menu entry, if it is a submenu.  If this
# menu entry is a top-level entry, set parent_id to 0.

# menu / entry title

# Arguments to command indicated by command_type (below)

# Command_type stores the type of response desired when this menu

# MenuEntry message.
#
# Each InteractiveMarker message has an array of MenuEntry messages.

# array.  The tree structure is represented by giving each menu entry
# an ID number and a "parent_id" field.  Top-level entries are the
# ones with parent_id = 0.  Menu entries are ordered within their
# level the same way they are ordered in the containing array.  Parent
# entries must appear before their children.
#
# Example:
# - id = 3
#   parent_id = 0
#   title = "fun"
# - id = 2
#   parent_id = 0
#   title = "robot"
# - id = 4
#   parent_id = 2
#   title = "pr2"
# - id = 5
#   parent_id = 2
#   title = "turtle"
#
# Gives a menu tree like this:
#  - fun
#  - robot
#    - pr2
#    - turtle

# ID is a number for each menu entry.  Must be unique within the
# control, and should never be 0.
